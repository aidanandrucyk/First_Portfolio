    <h1 id = "titleIntro">Hello World! My name is</h1>
    <h1 id = "titleName">Aidan Andrucyk <span class="wave">üëã</span></h1>
      <p>I am a second-year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://honorscollege.rutgers.edu/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">Honors College</a> of Rutgers University‚ÄìNew Brunswick with a <a href="unofficialTranscript.pdf" target="_blank">4.0 GPA</a>. I am pursuing a double major in <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-degrees/b-s-degree" target="_blank">computer science</a> and <a href="https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/research/architecture" target="_blank">cognitive science on the mind, machines, and computations</a> track with a minor in <a href="https://economics.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/minor-requirements" target="_blank">quantitative economics</a>. I have taken classes in data structures, computer architecture, linear algebra, and economic data analytics and I am always eager to expand my knowledge. I am currently a research assistant for <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Oq2vrEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Professor Samaneh G. Hamidi</a>, working in a team of five to develop machine learning algorithms with bayesian networks for modelling the economic effects of the coronavirus.</p>
      <p>As much as I love working in a dynamic problem-solving environment of software development, information technology, and data science, I also derive a deep personal satisfaction from serving the community. I volunteer my time as an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Z6tnQpkKP/" target="_blank">‚Äúalternative breaker,‚Äù</a> forgoing my winter breaks to travel to sites and help underserved communities such as those found on Catalina Island. I also serve as an Assistant Director for the <a href="https://www.rumun.net/about-idia" target="_blank">Institute for Domestic and International Affairs</a> where I help educate high schoolers on complex issues such as <a href="img/rumun2019.jpeg" target="_blank">economic expansion of ASEAN and the South China Sea crisis</a> by using parliamentary procedure to guide debate, maintain decorum, and ensure active and equal participation.</p>
      <p> When I am not working or serving the community, I love spending my time running outdoors, playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/" target= "_blank">Europa Universalis IV</a> with my friends, making <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-7ZpixzSDlatI4w54nVVqVvYTVWLxlcA-W00CILasI/edit#gid=0"  target= "_blank">spreadsheets</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aandrucyk.va/"  target= "_blank">capturing the world around me</a> with my camera.
